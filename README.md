## Resources:
  - PyCitySchools: represents my first anlysis (including Thomas High School ninth grade scores.

  - Resource Folder: Containes all of the csv files I used to determine my analysis and findings. 
  
## 1. Overview of the School District Analysis: Explain the Purpose of the Analysis 
The first analysis I completed *PyCitySchools* was used to help Maria (a chief data scientist for a city school district) analyze data on student funding and students' standardized test scores. To perform my analysis I was given access to every student's math and reading scores as well as various information on the schools they attend. My task was to aggregate the data and showcase the trends in school performance. My analysis helped assist the school board and superintendent in making decisions regarding the school budgets and priorities. My second analysis *PyCitySchools_Challenge* helped Maria and her supervisor provide evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders which appeared to have been altered. I helped Maria prove the extent of the academic dishonesty by replacing the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with "NaNs" while keeping the rest of the data intact. After doing so, I repeated my previous analysis which then helped Maria and I compare the difference to write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.
